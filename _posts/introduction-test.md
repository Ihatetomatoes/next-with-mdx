[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React framework, that simplifies a lot things that **you would need to add** to most React apps or sites.

Here are some of the things that `Next.js` gives you out of the box:

- file based routing (`pages/index.js`)
- dynamic route segments (`pages/unit/[id].js`)
- image optimization
- static site generation or server side rendering

There are many more benefits, but in this course we will focus on all of the above.

## What you will build

In this Next.js mini course we will create a simple microsite.

**This site**, exactly what you read now.

### The steps

- take content from markdown files
- generate dynamic urls for each course unit
- style everything with TailwindCSS
- use MDX to use React components in the markdown files
- deploy everything to Vercel
